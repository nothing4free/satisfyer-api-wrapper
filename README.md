# Satisfyer API Wrapper
A Python program that acts as a wrapper for the Satisfyer API used on their app, built as part of my first cybersecurity research project.<br>

## [!!] Disclaimer
This program has been made <b>FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY</b>. I have researched about the security on IoT areas that require extreme privacy and protection, and this is one of the tools I created to make this research easier and faster. I am not responsible for any use outside of researching and learning about how these things work. You know what to do and what not to do, don't be stupid.<br>
